====== Move ======

This plugin allows you to move and/or rename the current page or move and/or rename the current namespace within the following restrictions:

  * You must have edit permission for the current page/all pages in the current namespace.
  * The pages that are moved must not be locked for editing.
  * For moving a page you also need create permission in the target namespace.
  * You cannot move a page to a namespace where a page with the same name already exists.

All links to and from the pages that are moved will be updated to reflect the new location and/or name.
